     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters... planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl, spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.</Text>
     </Paragraph>
     <Paragraph Type="Action">
        <Text>An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.</Text>

        <Text>The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by a series of echoes.</Text>
